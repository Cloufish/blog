There are at least two (That’s how many I know) ways to configure iptables rules: By iptables command itself By ufw - Uncomplicated Firewall - which is also a commands tool, but it simplifies is a lot. Instead of running iptables command with flags; e.g. iptables -A INPUT -s &amp;lt;IP&amp;gt; -j ACCEPT, we are simply typing combination of keywords such as sudo ufw allow from &amp;... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>How to Take Better Notes?</title><link href="https://cloufish.github.io/blog/posts/How-To-Take-Better-Notes/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How to Take Better Notes?" /><published>2021-06-12T09:46:00+02:00</published> <updated>2021-06-12T09:46:00+02:00</updated> <id>https://cloufish.github.io/blog/posts/How-To-Take-Better-Notes/</id> <content src="https://cloufish.github.io/blog/posts/How-To-Take-Better-Notes/" /> <author> <name>Bartholomew Mokrzycki</name> </author> <category term="Productivity" /> <category term="Note-Taking" /> <summary> Disclaimer This content comes from the Book How to Take Smart Notes and Evergreen If you’re interested in diving deeper into psychological aspects, or you feel unconvinced or just because you need, feel free to reach those resources (or ask me questions, preferably! :D) Why even do Note-Taking?

Having an official and stable container will make it much easier to develop other blackarch containers, and I wish there was one when I was creating my container image. Is blackarch-zsh useless now? I don’t think that.

We then discussed a topic of Networking Service Object The Service Object from the Host/front-end perspective, acts as a static IP address, where from the Pod’s/back-end’s perspective it acts as a Loa... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Security of Docker Containers</title><link href="https://cloufish.github.io/blog/posts/Security-Of-Docker-Containers/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Security of Docker Containers" /><published>2021-05-17T07:46:00+02:00</published> <updated>2021-06-11T19:18:37+02:00</updated> <id>https://cloufish.github.io/blog/posts/Security-Of-Docker-Containers/</id> <content src="https://cloufish.github.io/blog/posts/Security-Of-Docker-Containers/" /> <author> <name>Bartholomew Mokrzycki</name> </author> <category term="DevSecOps" /> <category term="Docker" /> <summary> Intro The use of Docker Containers has changed completely on how we deploy our applications, many though think that all the apps running in the container are completely isolated from the host system and at the same time secure by default (Partially there are, but thinking something is 100% secure is bad assumption.)On this blog-post I’ll write about many mistakes in building Docker containers ... </summary> </entry> </feed>
